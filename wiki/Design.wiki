=== backpropagation package ===

 * backpropagation.java - This is the main neural networking class, it is generalized so it can handle any data given to it in the correct format

 * Format2.java - This class is going to be rewritten for each type of data that will be tested, while it sounds like a pain in the end it will allow for a generalization of the whole project and then the individual can create there own "Format2.java" class to specify how to handle they data they want to test.
