Notes about the new Format class:

This class needs to be rather efficient as it will become a bottle neck in the program
Everytime the number of input nodes changes the class will need to recreate the input data


The class needs to have some sort of cache and a check in the event that the dataSet being
requested was the same as the previous time in which case it will not have to run anything
extra.

The class needs to read through the input file once to get number of lines or needs to use
an arraylist to store all the lines of the input and then convert it to an array when finished.
This will eliminate the need to read from a file which is a massive bottleneck. At the same time it
needs to be finding the highest and lowest value.

After it inputs the data from a file, it then needs to take the information about the highest and lowest
numbers and then go through the entire list and normilize the data. 

All this needs to be done on the creation of the object, which will save a large amount of runtime during
the actual running of the NN

It then needs to include a method that is called to create the tInputs and the tOutputs, or turn them into two seperate
methods.
